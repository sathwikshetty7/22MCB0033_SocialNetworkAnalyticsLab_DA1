Social Network Analytics:Graph,Attributes,Centrality Measures

NetworkX is a Python package for complex graph network analysis.
Directed and UnDirected Graph Creation with weights Graph Attributes
Directed and UnDirected Graph Adjecency Matrix

Degree Centrality: It is the measure of the number of direct connections a node has in a network

Betweenness Centrality: It is the measure of the number of times a node falls on the shortest paths between other nodes in the network

Closeness Centrality: It is the measure of the average distance from a node to all other nodes in the network.

Eigen Vector Centeality: It is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all the nodes in the network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of a node than equal connection to low-scoring nodes.
